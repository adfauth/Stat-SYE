# Task List

## For September 11

1. Connect to git and github through Positron.

2. See if you can get birdnet running on the HPC.

## For September 4

1. Get Positron.

2. Run a local analysis on like 20 audio files and see how long it takes.

3. MH: Look into connecting git to positron (remind myself how to do this).





1. Read Kaitlin's SYE Paper, found at <https://github.com/kmhein21/eclipse_sye/blob/main/Write_Up/Write_up.pdf>. It's long! But as you're reading, do keep in mind how analyzing which species are appearing and making noise could be interwoven with the analysis.
